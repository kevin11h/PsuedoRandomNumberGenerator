# PsuedoRandomNumberGenerator
A winning response for a pseudorandom number generator base 6 for programming blockchain scholarship application.

  
    

Currently, I have set up an AWS Lambda function which creates an endpoint for this generator, exposing it as a service.

You can hit this endpoint if you so please. [(We know you want to, so heres the link)](https://6rvrv58xeh.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/Base6NumberGenerator)
